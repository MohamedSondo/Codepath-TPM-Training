## Milestone 6 Challenge Questions:
1. The flaws in the security of Apple, and Amazon accounts were beyond the control of the user.
2. The severity of the attack could be mitigated by reducing the amount of interlinking accounts by the user. In addition, the user can increase the amount of backups to reduce the possibility of losing irreplacable data. 
3. Two factor authentication can be used to reduce the chance a hacker is able to access the user's account.
4. The attacker may compare the username and password to rainbow tables and other cracked databases that are available online. This allows the attacker to find additional information, such as accounts or services, and possibly vulnerable passwords that were, and may still be in use.

## Notes

1. Milestone 1 revealed a problem attempting to send email through gmail. The dummy gmail account received the following notification: "Review blocked sign-in attempt", Google just blocked someone from signing into your google account from an app that may put your account at risk.
