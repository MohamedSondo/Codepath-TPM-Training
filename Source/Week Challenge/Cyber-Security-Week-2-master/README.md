## Notes

1. Coming in with practically no experience in SQL and, specifically, nuances and variations of certain inputs required significantly more outside reading to complete the assignment.

2. Spent way too much time guessing column names for SQL Injection Challenge Three(8 hours of on and off research, frustration, guessing, and breaks). Should have noticed the purple colored text that were hints to the names. However, as a result, I did learn more about checking for column names through research on SQL injection vulnerabilities. I would recommend allowing students limited access to information_schema.tables. That would reward outside research, and more critical thinking, vs. subtly giving the information in the problem explanation.

3. Interesting tidbit: The table also has a column named "customerid" which has a unique identifier for each customer in the table. Perhaps there are additional tables with even more information hidden?
