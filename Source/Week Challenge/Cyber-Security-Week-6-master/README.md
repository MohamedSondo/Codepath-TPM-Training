## Notes

1. Had a lot of trouble with Bonus 1, User Authentication. In terms of looking at just the code, it is not working properly. (All it does is return the "What's your favorite flower" regardless of what is inputted.) This is indeed a brute force problem, and probably requires some amount of research on some dump list of flowers.
2. User Authentication Challenge 2 was a tricky one to crack. On a personal level, web source code should be the first thing to check when looking for vulnerabilities. Error messages are hated, but no error messages when something isn't working right is far more terrible.
